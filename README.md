# CardShuffler

A nifty little deck shuffler. Takes the deck, splits it into two equal halves, then splices them into each other - one card at a time.

I wanted to see how many times I'd need to do this repition until the deck of cards returned to it's original state

Pull it down and runner 'runner.rb' to see the answer. 

Comment in the #prettyprint function near the end of 'cards.rb' to see the deck as it changes back to it's original state
